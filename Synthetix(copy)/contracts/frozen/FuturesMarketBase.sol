/*
 * Synthetic Futures
 * =================
 *
 * Futures markets allow users leveraged exposure to an asset, long or short.
 * A user must post some margin in order to open a futures account, and profits/losses are
 * continually tallied against this margin. If a user's margin runs out, then their position is closed
 * by a liquidation keeper, which is rewarded with a flat fee extracted from the margin.
 *
 * The Synthetix debt pool is effectively the counterparty to each trade, so if a particular position
 * is in profit, then the debt pool pays by issuing sUSD into their margin account,
 * while if the position makes a loss then the debt pool burns sUSD from the margin, reducing the
 * debt load in the system.
 *
 * As the debt pool underwrites all positions, the debt-inflation risk to the system is proportional to the
 * long-short skew in the market. It is therefore in the interest of the system to reduce the skew.
 * To encourage the minimisation of the skew, each position is charged a funding rate, which increases with
 * the size of the skew. The funding rate is charged continuously, and positions on the heavier side of the
 * market are charged the current funding rate times the notional value of their position, while positions
 * on the lighter side are paid at the same rate to keep their positions open.
 * As the funding rate is the same (but negated) on both sides of the market, there is an excess quantity of
 * funding being charged, which is collected by the debt pool, and serves to reduce the system debt.
 *
 * To combat front-running, the system does not confirm a user's order until the next price is received from
 * the oracle. Therefore opening a position is a three stage procedure: depositing margin, submitting an order,
 * and waiting for that order to be confirmed. The last transaction is performed by a keeper,
 * once a price update is detected.
 *
 * The contract architecture is as follows:
 *
 *     - FuturesMarket.sol:         one of these exists per asset. Margin is maintained isolated per market.
 *
 *     - FuturesMarketManager.sol:  the manager keeps track of which markets exist, and is the main window between
 *                                  futures markets and the rest of the system. It accumulates the total debt
 *                                  over all markets, and issues and burns sUSD on each market's behalf.
 *
 *     - FuturesMarketSettings.sol: Holds the settings for each market in the global FlexibleStorage instance used
 *                                  by SystemSettings, and provides an interface to modify these values. Other than
 *                                  the base asset, these settings determine the behaviour of each market.
 *                                  See that contract for descriptions of the meanings of each setting.
 *
 * Each futures market and the manager operates behind a proxy, and for efficiency they communicate with one another
 * using their underlying implementations.
 *
 * Technical note: internal functions within the FuturesMarket contract assume the following:
 *
 *     - prices passed into them are valid;
 *
 *     - funding has already been recomputed up to the current time (hence unrecorded funding is nil);
 *
 *     - the account being managed was not liquidated in the same transaction;

        calculation in _marketDebt().

        Explanation of the full market debt calculation from the SIP https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-80/:

        The overall market debt is the sum of the remaining margin in all positions. The intuition is that
        the debt of a single position is the value withdrawn upon closing that position.

        single position remaining margin = initial-margin + profit-loss + accrued-funding =
            = initial-margin + q * (price - last-price) + q * funding-accrued-per-unit
            = initial-margin + q * price - q * last-price + q * (funding - initial-funding)

        Total debt = sum ( position remaining margins )
            = sum ( initial-margin + q * price - q * last-price + q * (funding - initial-funding) )
            = sum( q * price ) + sum( q * funding ) + sum( initial-margin - q * last-price - q * initial-funding )
            = skew * price + skew * funding + sum( initial-margin - q * ( last-price + initial-funding ) )
            = skew (price + funding) + sum( initial-margin - q * ( last-price + initial-funding ) )

        The last term: sum( initial-margin - q * ( last-price + initial-funding ) ) being the position debt correction
            that is tracked with each position change using this method. 
        
        The first term and the full debt calculation using current skew, price, and funding is calculated globally in _marketDebt().
